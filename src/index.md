I am a software developer currently studying mathematics at the University of Toronto Scarborough. I've been leading open source projects and sysadmin work at [Mine in Abyss](https://mineinabyss.com) for over 5 years.

I recently completed a work term as a backend developer at [Sensei Labs](https://www.senseilabs.com/), where I worked with a big .NET application and lots of SQL queries. You can find my personal projects in the tab above, too.

In my spare time, I've been learning the piano, trying to find a use for my home server, and getting dangerously close to purchasing [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/).
